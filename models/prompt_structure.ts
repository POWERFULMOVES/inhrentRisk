This could increase the likelihood of suspicious transactions. However, the mitigating control score is high because the bank has an AML compliance program that includes training for employees on identifying red flags and signs of money laundering, as well as independent review of the program by a third-party service provider (SIRS). This suggests that the bank has taken steps to mitigate the risks associated with its increasing customer base. The specific part from Section 4.e (Joint Filing of SARs with Other Financial Institutions) is relevant because it shows that the bank has a process in place for jointly filing SARs with other financial institutions, which could help identify and report suspicious transactions. }`;
